# "SurfsUp" Week 9 Challenge
## Overview of the Weather Analysis
<!--- Explain the purpose of this analysis. --->
The purpose of this analysis is to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu during the months of June and December. This will allow us to determine whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business can be sustainable all year-round. By creating a query that captures the temperatures for the months of June and December, we can retrieve statistical calculations such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.

## Results
<!--- Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed. --->
![Dataframe summary of June](https://github.com/rudiferr/SurfsUp_analysis/blob/main/Resources/june_Temps.png)
Based on the analysis, we can see that there are 1,700 observations for the months of June between the years of 2010 and 2017. The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are listed above. The low standard deviation implies there is a relatively small spread across the observed temperatures. This makes sense as Oahu weather does not seem to fluctuate significantly, especially for a location that is known for its appeal in the spring and summer seasons.

December, on the other hand, only having 1,517 observation indicates that there are some dates that are missing temperature recordings. However, being quite a large sample size does not discredit our analysis being representative. From the charts, we can see that June and December are close in a lot of statistical metrics such as average, maximum, and minimum temperature. More importantly, the spread is about the same as the spread for the month of June.

## Summary
<!--- Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December. --->
Looking at the statistic summary of June and December, we can conclude that the temperature patterns are quite consistent throughout the summer and winter seasons. However, there are two more queries that we need to include to get a better understanding of the weather on Oahu. Although temperatures may remain about the same throughout the year, precipitation might not be and would also have a significant impact on the business's sustainability, especially if we are considering a potential beach-side location. Doing a statistically summary of the weather, specifically precipitation patterns, during these months will give us better insight and make a more educated plan.

Along these lines, observing the weather patterns throught the Fall season is almost as necessary as a temperature analysis considering we are potentially findiing a location in Oahu. Island nations in the Pacific are known for heavy seasons of rain during the months of September and October. If we potentially have to close business during any days of these months due to heavy precipitation that could be a large impact in yearly revenue and sustainbility during outside of the yearly vacation seasons.
